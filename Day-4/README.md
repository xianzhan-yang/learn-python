**Question:**

Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a list of numbers (separated by spaces), and then prints:

1. The sum of all the numbers in the list.
2. The largest number in the list.
3. The smallest number in the list.

**Expected Learning Outcomes:**

- Understanding how to handle lists in Python.
- Using input() to collect user data.
- Using built-in functions like sum(), max(), and min().

**Example Input/Output:**

Input:

```
Enter numbers separated by spaces: 3 5 7 2 8 10
```

Output:

```
Sum of numbers: 35
Largest number: 10
Smallest number: 2
```

**Bonus Challenge:**

Modify the program to calculate and print the average of the numbers in the list.
