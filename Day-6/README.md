**Question:**

Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a list of numbers (separated by commas), and then:

1. Prints the sum of all the numbers in the list.
2. Prints the average of the numbers in the list.
3. Prints the count of even numbers in the list.
4. Prints the count of odd numbers in the list.

**Expected Learning Outcomes:**

- Working with lists and strings.
- Using loops to iterate over list items.
- Basic mathematical operations like sum and average.
- Understanding conditions like checking if a number is even or odd.

**Example Input/Output:**

Input:

```
Enter numbers separated by commas: 3, 5, 7, 2, 8, 10
```

Output:

```
Sum of numbers: 35
Average of numbers: 5.83
Even numbers count: 3
Odd numbers count: 3
```

**Bonus Challenge:**

Extend the program to also print the largest and smallest number in the list.
