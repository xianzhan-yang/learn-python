**Question:**

Write a Python program that asks the user to input two numbers and then outputs the sum, difference, product, and quotient of those numbers.

**Expected Learning Outcomes:**

- Understanding user input.
- Performing basic arithmetic operations.
- Working with variables and displaying results.

**Example Input/Output:**

```
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 3

Sum: 8
Difference: 2
Product: 15
Quotient: 1.6666666666666667
```

**Bonus Challenge:**

Modify the program to handle cases where the user tries to divide by zero (e.g., by showing an error message instead of a crash).
