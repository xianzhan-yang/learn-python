**Question:**

Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a word, and then:

1. Prints the word in reverse.
2. Prints the word in uppercase.
3. Prints the word in lowercase.

**Expected Learning Outcomes:**

- Understanding how to manipulate strings.
- Using string methods like .upper(), .lower(), and slicing.
- Getting comfortable with basic input/output.

**Example Input/Output:**

Input:

```
Enter a word: Python
```

Output:

```
Reversed word: nohtyP
Uppercase word: PYTHON
Lowercase word: python
```

**Bonus Challenge:**

Modify the program to check if the word is a palindrome (a word that reads the same forward and backward, like "radar"). Print whether the word is a palindrome or not.
