**Question:**

Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a number and then prints whether the number is even or odd.

**Expected Learning Outcomes:**

- Understanding conditional statements (if and else).
- Working with the modulus operator (%).
- Using user input to influence program flow.

**Example Input/Output:**

```
Enter a number: 4
The number 4 is even.

Enter a number: 7
The number 7 is odd.
```

**Bonus Challenge:**

Extend the program to check if the number is positive, negative, or zero in addition to checking whether it's even or odd.
