# learn-python
Question-1

Write a Python program that asks the user for their name, then greets them with a personalized message.

Expected Learning Outcomes:

- Understanding input and output in Python.
- Using variables to store and manipulate data.
- Familiarity with Python's print() function and string formatting.

Example Input/Output:
```
What is your name? Alice
Hello, Alice! Welcome to learning Python.
```

Bonus Challenge:
Enhance the program to ask the user for their age and calculate the year they'll turn 100.

Example Input/Output:

```
What is your name? Bob
How old are you? 25
Hello, Bob! You will turn 100 years old in the year 2099.
```

Question-2

Write a Python program that asks the user to input two numbers and then outputs the sum, difference, product, and quotient of those numbers.

Expected Learning Outcomes:

- Understanding user input.
- Performing basic arithmetic operations.
- Working with variables and displaying results.

Example Input/Output:
```
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 3

Sum: 8
Difference: 2
Product: 15
Quotient: 1.6666666666666667
```

Bonus Challenge:

Modify the program to handle cases where the user tries to divide by zero (e.g., by showing an error message instead of a crash).

Question-3

Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a number and then prints whether the number is even or odd.

Expected Learning Outcomes:

- Understanding conditional statements (if and else).
- Working with the modulus operator (%).
- Using user input to influence program flow.

Example Input/Output:

```
Enter a number: 4
The number 4 is even.

Enter a number: 7
The number 7 is odd.
```

Bonus Challenge:

Extend the program to check if the number is positive, negative, or zero in addition to checking whether it's even or odd.
